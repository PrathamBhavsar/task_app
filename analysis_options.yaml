 # This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
 # check for errors, warnings, and lints.
 #
 # The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
 # IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
 # invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

 # The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
 # packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
